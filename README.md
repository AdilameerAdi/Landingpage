This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:

```
# Cloudflare Turnstile
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_turnstile_site_key
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=your_turnstile_secret_key

# Discord Webhook
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy
```

Notes:
- The contact form uses Cloudflare Turnstile. If keys are missing, submission will fail server-side.
- The form posts to `/api/contact` which formats the payload as a Discord embed and sends it to the configured webhook.
